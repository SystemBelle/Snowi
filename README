Snowi
Jamie Carranza

Snowi is a simple Ruby/Sinatra based Nagios web interface suitable for mobile devices.  It's sort of a clone
of Nag Small Screen by Ryan McDonald.

	Alerts can be acknowledged or un-acknowledged using Nagios' 'external commands' feature.
	If logged in using HTTP authentication methods, the user available in the HTTP_X_REMOTE_USER variable is noted as
	the acknowledging party.

	Parses the 'status.dat' file produced by Nagios
	The defaults are fine for many installations and correspond with the defaults you get with Nagios
	Nagios Mobile requires Ruby 1.8 and the following gems: sinatra, haml, parseconfig
	Have the main HTTP server act as a reverse proxy for the port/socket this server listens on
