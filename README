Nagios Mobile
Jamie Carranza

# Nagios Mobile is a simple Ruby/Sinatra based Nagios web interface suitable for mobile devices.  It's sort of a clone
# of Nag Small Screen by Ryan McDonald.

	# Alerts can be acknowledged or un-acknowledged using Nagios' 'external commands' feature.
	# If logged in using HTTP authentication methods, the user available in the HTTP_X_REMOTE_USER variable is noted as
	# the acknowledging party.

	# Parses the 'status.dat' file produced by Nagios
	# The defaults are fine for many installations and correspond with the defaults you get with Nagios
	# Nagios Mobile requires Ruby 1.8 and the following gems: sinatra, haml, parseconfig
	# Have the main HTTP server rewrite/redirect requests for '/mobile' to the port this server listens on
